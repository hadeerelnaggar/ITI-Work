## Moving Ball
This app has a ball that moves within the screen borders and changes it's direction when it hits the screen border. It has a pause button to stop the movement of the ball and a resume button to continue. Another thread is used to change the position of the ball and when the ball is paused this thread waits until the ball is resumed again.
